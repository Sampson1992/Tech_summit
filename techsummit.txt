My tech summit experience

In my summit, i learnt alot about the emerging technologies
and how African can take that opportunity.
There were varirous speaker who turns in speaking at the summit.
We had the CEO of Amazon and Microsoft honouring the the occasion.
One thing that got me thinking the most is about the the growing trend of cloud Teachnilgy.
